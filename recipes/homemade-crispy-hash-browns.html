    <p>If you're a firm believer that potatoes make basically any meal taste better, then you've come to the right place. Because we are too — especially when it comes to breakfast potatoes.
    <br>Choosing which type of breakfast potato to make can be a tough decision, but if you're craving crispy potatoes that remind you of your favorite restaurant, then you should try this hash brown recipe. The shredded potatoes are formed into pancake-like hash browns and lightly pan-fried for the perfect crispy texture that will pair deliciously with any breakfast dish.</p>
    <h2>How to Make Hash Browns</h2>
    <a>Believe it or not, making crispy hash browns is actually quite easy. First, shred your potatoes using your preferred method — either with a grater, food processor, or mandoline. Rinse the potatoes until the water is clear, then drain and squeeze out all the remaining liquid (this will ensure the hash browns are extra crispy).
    <br>Next, you'll add in your binding agents (flour and egg) as well as any other ingredients or seasonings. This recipe only calls for onion, but you could also add cheese, cayenne pepper, or garlic to the mixture.
        
    <br>Form your hash browns into patties (either one large hash brown or multiple smaller pancake-like hash browns) and pan fry them in oil, about five minutes on each side.</a>
    <h3>How to Make Hash Browns Crispy</h3>
    <p>To keep your hash browns crispy, make sure to heat the oil to sizzling before adding the patties and wait until the one side is golden brown before flipping.
    <br>You can also make your hash browns thinner because they will get crispier and cook more evenly.</p>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Rinse shredded potatoes until water is clear, then drain and squeeze dry.</li>
        <li>Place shreds in a bowl and mix in the onion, flour, and egg until evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is sizzling hot, place potatoes into the pan in a 1/2 inch thick layer. Cover the whole bottom of the pan, or make separate piles like pancakes.</li>
        <li>Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, then flip over and brown on the other side. It should take at least 5 minutes per side. If you are cooking them in one big piece, it can be cut into quarters for easier flipping.</li>
        <li>Remove from pan, and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
